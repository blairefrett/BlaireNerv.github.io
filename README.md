-   Question: Is there a relationship between crashes and car ownership in Oakland?

-   Street network?

-   Oakland DOT data?

-   What are the characteristics of where the crash occurred?

-   Percentile ranking 

-   Areas with high collision, high vehicle ownership, 4 lanes of traffic 

-   Oakland street file network 

-   TIMS → traffic injury mapping system 

-   Car ownership → census data 

-   Car ownership dates from the census 

-   Other factors: Number of lanes, posted speed

-   Spatial patterns of vehicular crashes compared to car ownership rates

Data: 

Car ownership

TIMS 

Oakland streets (number of lanes, posted speeds)

High Injury Network?

-   What does it mean that people who own cars are likely driving away from the block group?

-   Address this in the write-up 

-   Local roads are more heavily trafficked by local users 

-   More likely to have the effect be on local traffic

-   Consider doing this at multiple spatial scales: block, block group, census tract

-   And see if the results are consistent

Question: What is the relationship between road conditions and the number of pedestrian and bicycle collisions?

-   Are there locations within the city that are hotspots for collisions?

Question:

What is the relationship between the Oakland street network and vehicular collisions?

1.  What is the racial/ethnic demographics of neighborhoods with the highest rate of pedestrian collisions?

1.  What street network characteristics could be influencing this rate?

1.  speed limit

2.  number of lanes

3.  protecting bike lanes?

To Do:

Plot collisions on map 

Plot demographics on map 

Which census tracts have the most vehicular and pedestrian collisions?
